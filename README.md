# RTS Software Development Standards

## Purpose

Jyot has asked that developers choose a standard set of frameworks and tools so that we can transition between projects more easily.

## Javascript

### Style guide: Airbnb
* https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

It is recommended to configure your editor to use eslint and check against the airbnb style guide.

### View framework: React
* https://facebook.github.io/react/
* https://github.com/facebook/react
* https://reactforbeginners.com/

### Build tools: Webpack, Babel
* https://webpack.github.io/
* https://babeljs.io/

React apps can be quickly bootstrapped using https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app. This lets you use webpack and ES6 with zero effort.
